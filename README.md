##### `bookmark your favorite file , folder and website`

I am an independent developer. I used to work in iOS development. I am currently developing a game. I often spend a lot of time searching for information, and  I need to collect the webpage and local files, server files, quickly switch between these materials, I had been used to do it in Evernote, but I found its still not convenient, in fact, my demand is to collect resource paths, quick access, I wrote a small  app to collect these links, the app was originally not intended to be published by the application, but the app is really easy to use, my wife is also using this app, every time she said that this app is so convenient, it can be released In the AppStore, so I take several days, make icon, unify the UI looking, write help documents, and make a lot of optimization adjustments to the app, Today the app (Hungrymark) is on sale now current price less than $1.  It's so convenient that I recommend you try it.
